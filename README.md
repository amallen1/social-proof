## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use CSS and Flexbox together a little more seamlessly. Thanks to this project, I also learned about
file architecture when it comes to using SASS. I used to just use one Sass file but I'm learning for more complex projects and to be organized in general it's best to split files up.

Also one of the biggest obstacles for me during this challenge was understanding when to use Flexbox vs Grid. Flexbox made it really easy to create the mobile version of the design, but I was a little overwhelemed when I had to implement the design for tablets and desktop screen sizes.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu5mdN2JIwM&ab_channel=TraversyMedia) - This video helped me to understand the file structure that is best practice when using SASS.

- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K27WULzr2P8&ab_channel=KevinPowell) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

I really look up to Kevin Powell and I know that he has a lot of experience with CSS. I was having trouble understanding how to transition from mobile screen to desktops while making sure the design looks good responsively.
