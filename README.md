## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to use CSS and Flexbox together a little more seamlessly. Thanks to this project, I also learned about
file architecture when it comes to using SASS. I used to just use one Sass file but I'm learning for more complex projects and to be organized in general it's best to split files up.

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

-- 

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu5mdN2JIwM&ab_channel=TraversyMedia) - This video helped me to understand the file structure that is best practice when using SASS. 

- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
